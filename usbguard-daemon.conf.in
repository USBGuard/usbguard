# Generate device specific rules including the "via-port"
# attribute.
#
# This option modifies the behavior of the allowDevice
# action. When instructed to generate a permanent rule,
# the action can generate a port specific rule. Because
# some systems have unstable port numbering, the generated
# rule might not match the device after rebooting the system.
#
# If set to false, the generated rule will still contain
# the "parent-hash" attribute which also defines an association
# to the parent device. See usbguard-rules.conf(5) for more
# details.
