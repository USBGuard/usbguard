# /etc/usbguard/rules.d/. The USBGuard daemon is supposed to
# behave like any other standard Linux daemon therefore it
# loads rule files in alpha-numeric order. File names inside
# RuleFolder directory should start with a two-digit number
# prefix indicating the position, in which the rules are
# scanned by the daemon.

# Control which devices are authorized by default.
#
# The USBGuard daemon modifies some the default authorization state attributes
# of controller devices. This setting, enables you to define what value the
# default authorization is set to.
#
# * keep         - do not change the authorization state
# * none         - every new device starts out deauthorized
# * all          - every new device starts out authorized
# * internal     - internal devices start out authorized, external devices start
#                  out deauthorized (this requires the ACPI tables to properly
#                  label internal devices, and kernel support)
#
AuthorizedDefault=none

#
# Restore controller device state.
#
# The USBGuard daemon modifies some attributes of controller
# devices like the default authorization state of new child device
# instances. Using this setting, you can control whether the
# daemon will try to restore the attribute values to the state
# before modification on shutdown.
#
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS: If set to true, the USB authorization
# policy could be bypassed by performing some sort of attack on the
# daemon (via a local exploit or via a USB device) to make it shutdown
# and restore to the operating-system default state (known to be permissive).

# Device manager backend
#
# Which device manager backend implementation to use. One of:
#
# * uevent   - Netlink based implementation which uses sysfs to scan for present

#              related events.
# * umockdev - umockdev based device manager capable of simulating devices based
#              on umockdev-record files. Useful for testing.

# IPC access control definition files path.

# daemon as access control definition files for the IPC interface.
# The (base)name of a file should be in the form:

#
# where user is either username or UID and group is either groupname or GID.
# IPC access control files should contain lines in the form:
#
#   <section>=[privilege1][,privilege2] ...
#
# This way each file defines who is able to connect to the IPC
# bus and what privileges he has. Note that the IPC access control
# files need to have file permissions set to 0600.

# Generate device specific rules including the "via-port"
# attribute.
#
# This option modifies the behavior of the allowDevice
# action. When instructed to generate a permanent rule,
# the action can generate a port specific rule. Because
# some systems have unstable port numbering, the generated
# rule might not match the device after rebooting the system.
#
# If set to false, the generated rule will still contain
# the "parent-hash" attribute which also defines an association
# to the parent device. See usbguard-rules.conf(5) for more
# details.
