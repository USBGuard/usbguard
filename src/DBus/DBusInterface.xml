      List devices that match the specified query. The query uses the rule
      language syntax and the devices are returned as device specific rules.
      The target in each rule represents the current authorization state of
      the device. Order of the returned devices is not defined and should not
      be relied upon.

      Example queries:
       - 'match': Matches any device.
       - 'allow': Matches only authorized devices.
       - 'block': Matches only unauthorized devices.
       - 'match with-interface one-of { 03:00:01 03:01:01 }': Matches any device with a HID/Keyboard interface.

      If the permanent flag is set to True, a rule will be appended to the policy or an exiting device
      rule will be modified in order to permanently store the authorization decision.

      Notify that a USB device was already present when USBGuard was started. Note
      that currently this signal is of little use to 3rd-party application developers
      as the signal won't reach any clients on the bus because the bus connections
      are handled after the devices are processed. However, the internal processing
      routines may change in the future so this signal is provided and documented
      for completeness.

      The device attribute dictionary contains the following attributes:
        - id (the USB device ID in the form VID:PID)
        - name
        - serial
        - via-port
        - hash
        - parent-hash
        - with-interface
        - with-connect-type (either "hardwired", "hotplug", or the empty string for unknown)

      The USB interface types are represented as strings of the form AA:BB:CC, where AA,
      BB, and CC are hexadecimal numbers representing the class, subclass and protocol
      of the interface  as defined by the USB standard.
