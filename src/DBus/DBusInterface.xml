    org.usbguard.Devices:

    The org.usbguard.Devices interface provides access to USB

      List devices that match the specified query. The query uses the rule
      language syntax and the devices are returned as device specific rules.
      The target in each rule represents the current authorization state of
      the device. Order of the returned devices is not defined and should not
      be relied upon.

      Example queries:
       - 'match': Matches any device.
       - 'allow': Matches only authorized devices.
       - 'block': Matches only unauthorized devices.
       - 'match with-interface one-of { 03:00:01 03:01:01 }': Matches any device with a HID/Keyboard interface.

       @target: The current authorization target of the device. 

      Notify that a USB device was already present when USBGuard was started. Note
      that currently this signal is of little use to 3rd-party application developers
      as the signal won't reach any clients on the bus because the bus connections
      are handled after the devices are processed. However, the internal processing
      routines may change in the future so this signal is provided and documented
      for completeness.

      The device attribute dictionary contains the following attributes:
        - name
        - vendor_id
        - product_id
        - serial
        - port

      The USB interface types are represented as strings of the form AA:BB:CC, where AA,
      BB, and CC are hexadecimal numbers representing the class, subclass and protocol
      of the interface  as defined by the USB standard.

       @rule_match: A boolean flag specifying whether the device matched a rule in the policy.
       @rule_id: A rule id of the matched rule. Otherwise a reserved rule id value is used.

      Notify that a USB device was inserted into the system. When a newly inserted
      device is recognized by the USBGuard daemon, it will try to match it against
      the current rule set. If a match is found, the authorization target from the
      matched rule is applied on the device. Otherwise, the implicit policy target
      is applied. A separate signal is sent after a policy target is applied on a
      device (see DeviceAllowed, DeviceBlocked, DeviceRejected signals).

      If a client application wants to apply a different target to a device, it may
      do so using the allowDevice, blockDevice or rejectDevice methods or modify the
      policy using the org.usbguard.Policy interface so that the policy contains the
      desired (de)authorization rule.
