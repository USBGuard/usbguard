== About

USBGuard is a software framework for implementing USB device authorization policies (what kind of USB devices are authorized) as well as method of use policies (how a USB device may interact with the system).
Simply put, it is a USB device allowlisting tool.

== Documentation

 * User Guide (TBA)
 * Manual Pages

== Compilation & Installation

WARNING: *Prior to starting the USBGuard daemon (or service) for the first time*
         (but after installation)
         we need to
         generate a rules file for USBGuard so that the currently attached
         USB devices (in particular mouse and keyboard) keep working
         so that you will not **get locked out of your system**.
         More on that below at <<before-the-first-start, Before the First Start>>.

To compile the source code, you will require at least C{plus}{plus}17. +
If you are compiling sources from a release tarball, you'll need the development files for:

 * https://github.com/ClusterLabs/libqb[libqb] - used for local UNIX socket based IPC
 * https://github.com/google/protobuf[protobuf] - used for IPC message (de)serialization
 * https://download.libsodium.org[libsodium] or https://www.gnupg.org/software/libgcrypt[libgcrypt] - used for hashing
 * https://asciidoc.org[asciidoc (a2x)] - needed to generate documentation

Optionally, you may want to install:

 * https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp[libseccomp] - used to implement a syscall whitelist
 * https://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/libcap-ng/[libcap-ng] - used to drop process capabilities

If you are on a Debian based GNU/Linux distribution like Ubuntu 21.10,
installation of all build dependencies would be something like this:

    $ sudo apt update && \
      sudo apt install --no-install-recommends -V \
        asciidoc autoconf automake bash-completion build-essential catch \
        docbook-xml docbook-xsl git ldap-utils libaudit-dev libcap-ng-dev \
        libdbus-glib-1-dev libldap-dev libpolkit-gobject-1-dev libprotobuf-dev \
        libqb-dev libseccomp-dev libsodium-dev libtool libxml2-utils \
        libumockdev-dev pkg-config protobuf-compiler sudo tao-pegtl-dev xsltproc

And then do:

    $ ./configure        # for arguments of interest see below
    $ make
    $ make check         # if you would like to run the test suite
    $ sudo make install

Configure arguments that deserve explicit mentioning (quoting `./configure --help` output):

      --enable-systemd        install the systemd service unit file (default=no)

      --with-crypto-library   Select crypto backend library. Supported values:
                              sodium, gcrypt, openssl.

      --with-bundled-catch    Build using the bundled Catch library

      --with-bundled-pegtl    Build using the bundled PEGTL library

      --with-ldap             Build USBGuard with ldap support

If you want to compile the sources in a cloned repository, you'll have to run the `./autogen.sh` script.
It will fetch the sources (via git submodules) of https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL/[PEGTL] and https://github.com/philsquared/Catch[Catch].
The script will then initialize the autotools based build system, e.g. generate the `./configure` script.

== Before the First Start

*Prior to starting the USBGuard daemon (or service) for the first time*
(but after installation)
we need to
generate a rules file for USBGuard so that the currently attached
USB devices (in particular mouse and keyboard) keep working
so that you will not **get locked out of your system**.

A rules file can be generated like this:

    $ sudo sh -c 'usbguard generate-policy > /etc/usbguard/rules.conf'

After that, you can safely start service `usbguard`:

    $ sudo systemctl start usbguard.service

And you can make systemd start the service every time your boot your machine:

    $ sudo systemctl enable usbguard.service
