### Changed
- Qt Applet: disabled session management
- usbguard-daemon console logging output is enabled by default now. Previously,
  the -k option had to be passed to enable the output.
- Replaced --enable-maintainer-mode configure option with --enable-full-test-suite
  option. When the new option is not used during the configure phase, only a basic
  set of test is run during the make check phase.

- Fixed UEventDeviceManager to work with Linux Kernel >= 4.13
- Refactored audit logging to support different audit log backends
- Reformatted source code to conform to the code style.

## 0.7.0 - 2017-04-12
### Added
- Added InsertedDevicePolicy configuration option to control the policy
  method for inserted devices.

- Qt Applet: Added Spanish (es_AR) translation.
- Create empty rules.conf file at install time (make install).
- Support for numeric UID/GID values in IPCAllowedUsers and IPCAllowedGroups
  settings.
- If bash completion support is detected at configure time, install the bash

- IPC access is now configurable down to a section and privilege
  level per user and/or group.
- Added add-user, remove-user usbuard CLI subcommands for creating, removing
  IPC access control files.

  USBGuard audit events log file path. If set, the usbguard-daemon will log
  policy and device related actions and whether they succeeded or not.

### Removed
- Removed UDev based device manager backend and UDev related dependencies.
- Removed UDev development files/API dependency

### Changed
- Reset Linux root hub bcdDevice value before updating device hash. This is
  a backwards incompatible change because it changes how the device hash is
  computed for Linux root hub devices.
- Refactored low-level USB device handling into SysFSDevice class which
  represents a device in the /sys filesystem (sysfs).
- Removed usage of `readdir_r` because it's obsolete. Replaced with readdir
  with the assumption that its usage is thread-safe if the directory handle
  passed to it is not shared between threads.
- Extended test suite with use case tests.
- Install the usbguard-daemon configuration and policy file with strict file
  permissions to prevent policy leaks.
- Fixed several memory leaks.
- Don't pre-resolve user and group names in IPCAllowedUsers and IPCAllowedGroups
  settings. Instead, resolve the name during the IPC authentication phase.

  syntax error instead of continuing with an empty rule set

## 0.5.11 - 2016-08-13
### Added
- Maintainer script for spellchecking source archive files
- Rule::Attribute class for representing the rule attributes
- USBDeviceID class for representing the USB device ID
- configure script option to control the bundling of PEGTL source files

### Changed
- **IMPORTANT**: The device hash value computation was changed to include the
  USB descriptor data. Additionally, the algorithm was changed to SHA-256 and
  the hash value representation to base64. These changes are backwards incompatible
  and existing policies that use the hash attribute need to be updated.
- Reimplemented the rule parser using PEGTL
- Changed public API of the Rule and Device classes because of the new
  Rule::Attribute class rule attribute representation
- Extended the public IPCClient::IPCDisconnected method to include exception
  related information
- All rule attributes now support both the single and multivalued form
- A rule attribute can now be specified only once
- The default usbguard-daemon.conf and usbguard.service files now respect
  the paths set by the configure script
- New Qt applet icons with
- Fixed Qt applet so that it doesn't show an empty window when starting
- Qt Applet: Reject button is hidden by default.
- Updated usbguard-daemon manual page
- Permanent device specific rules managed by allowDevice, blockDevice and
  rejectDevice actions are now handled properly. Existing device rules are
  updated instead of just appending new rules to the policy.
- usbguard-daemon.conf: changed the default configuration value of
  PresentControllerPolicy to keep
- Changed the device hashing algorithm to SHA-256
- Switched hash value representation from hex to base64

### Removed
- Removed Quex related files
- The "from Rule" Device class constructor was removed because it's use case
  is unclear and it wasn't used anywhere

## 0.5.10 - 2016-07-08
### Changed
- Changed versioning scheme to include a release number. Releases will be
  rolled out more often during a milestone (x.y -- currently 0.5) development.
- Enhancements of the usbguard command-line interface.
- Manual pages are now generated from their source (markdown) during the build
  process.
- A default usbguard-daemon configuration file is now installed.

### Added
- Merged usbguard-applet-qt (sub)project into usbguard.
- Added a D-Bus bridge component which exposes a D-Bus interface to usbguard.

### Fixed
- Fixed USB descriptor data parsing. Previously, many real-world cases of
  descriptors weren't parsed correctly because of a naive implementation of the
  parser.
- Fixed systemd integration.
- Fixed issues: #84, #83, #80, #79, #78, #77, #76, #75, #74, #73, #72, #71,
  #70, #69, #68, #56, #54, #53, #51, #50, #44.

## 0.4 - 2016-02-07
### Changed
- The daemon is now capable of dropping process capabilities and uses a seccomp
  based syscall whitelist. Options to enable these features were added to the
  usbguard-daemon command.
- Devices connected at the start of the daemon are now recognized and the
  DevicePresent signal is sent for each of them.
- The library API was extended with the Device and DeviceManager classes.
- Implemented the usbguard CLI, see usbguard(1) for available commands.
- Initial authorization policies can be now easily generated using the usbguard
  generate-policy command.
- Extended the rule language with rule conditions. See usbguard-rules.conf(5)
  for details.
- Moved logging code into the shared library. You can use static methods of the
  Logger class to configure logging behaviour.
- Removed the bundled libsodium and libqb libraries.

### Added
- New configuration options for setting the implicit policy target and how to
  handle the present devices are now available.

### Fixed
- String values read from the device are now properly escaped and length limits
  on these values are enforced.
- Fixed several bugs.
- Resolved issues: #46, #45, #41, #40, #37, #32, #31, #28, #25, #24, #21, #16,
  #13, #9, #4

### Removed
- The device hashing procedure was altered and generates different hash values.
  If you are using the hash attribute in your rules, you'll have to update the
  values.
- The bundled libsodium and libqb were removed. You'll have to compile and
  install them separately if your distribution doesn't provide them as
  packages.

## 0.3p3 - 2015-04-14

- Implemented basic USB descriptor structure parsing and improved
  interface type handling
- The IPC API was changed:
  - added new signal, DevicePresent, which signals that a device was
    already present at the start of the IPC session
  - the DeviceInserted and DevicePresent signals pass interface types that
    the device supports
