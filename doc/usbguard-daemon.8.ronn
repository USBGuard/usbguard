usbguard-daemon(8) -- A tool for implementing USB device usage policy
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`usbguard-daemon` [<options>]

## DESCRIPTION

The USBGuard software framework helps to protect your computer against rogue USB devices (a.k.a. BadUSB) by implementing basic whitelisting/blacklisting capabilities based on USB device attributes.

## OPTIONS

 * `-d`
   Enable debugging messages in the log.

 * `-s`
   Log to syslog.

 * `-k`
   Log to console.

 * `-l <path>`
   Log to a file at _path_.

 * `-p <path>`
   Write PID to a file at _path_.

 * `-c <path>`
   Load configuration from a file at _path_ (default: _/etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf_).

 * `-h`
   Show the help/usage screen.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

The daemon provides the USBGuard public IPC interface. Depending on your distribution defaults, the access to this interface is limited to a certain group or a specific user only. Please refer to the usbguard-daemon.conf(5) man-page for more information on how to configure the ACL correctly. *Do not leave the ACL unconfigured as that will expose the IPC interface to all local users and will allow them to manipulate the authorization state of USB devices and modify the USBGuard policy*.
