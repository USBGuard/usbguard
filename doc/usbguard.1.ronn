## DESCRIPTION

The `usbguard` command provides a command-line interface (CLI) to the `usbguard-daemon`(8) instance and provides a tool for generating initial USBGuard policies.

## OPTIONS

## SUB-COMMANDS

`usbguard list-devices`

List all USB devices recognized by the USBGuard daemon.

Available options:

 * `-a`,`--allowed`
   List allowed devices.

 * `-b`.`--blocked`
   List blocked devices.

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard allow-device [<OPTIONS>] <id>`

Authorize a device identified by the device *id* to interact with the system.

Available options:

 * `-p`,`--permanent`
   Make the decision permanent. A device specific allow rule will be appended to the current policy.

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard block-device [<OPTIONS>] <id>`

Deauthorize a device indentified by the device *id*.

Available options:

 * `-p`,`--permanent`
   Make the decision permanent. A device specific block rule will be appended to the current policy.

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard reject-device [<OPTIONS>] <id>`

Deauthorize and remove a device indentified by the device *id*.

Available options:

 * `-p`,`--permanent`
   Make the decision permanent. A device specific reject rule will be appended to the current policy.

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard list-rules [<OPTIONS>]`

List the rule set (policy) used by the USBGuard daemon.

Available options:

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard append-rule [<OPTIONS>] <rule>`

Append the *rule* to the current rule set.

Available options:

 * `-a`,`--after <id>`
   Append the new rule after a rule with the specified rule *id*.

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard remove-rule [<OPTIONS>] <id>`

Remove a rule identified by the rule *id* from the rule set.

Available options:

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard generate-policy [<OPTIONS>]`

Generate a rule set (policy) which authorizes the currently connected USB devices.

Available options:

 * `-p`,`--with-ports`
   Generate port specific rules for all devices. By default, port specific rules are generated only for devices which do not export an iSerial value.

 * `-P`,`--no-ports-sn`
   Don't generate port specific rules for devices without an iSerial value. Without this option, the tool will add a via-port attribute to any device that doesn't provide a serial number. This is a security measure to limit devices that cannot be uniquely identified to connect only via a specific port. This makes it harder to bypass the policy since the real device will ocupy the allowed USB port most of the time.

 * `-t`,`--target <target>`
   Generate an explicit "catch all" rule with the specified target. The target can be one of the following values: `allow`, `block`, `reject`.

 * `-X`,`--no-hashes`
   Don't generate a hash attribute for each device.

 * `-H`,`--hash-only`
   Generate a hash-only policy.

 * `-h`,`--help`
   Show help.

`usbguard watch [<OPTIONS>]`

Watch the IPC interface events and print them to stdout.

Available options:

 * `-h`,`--help`
    Show help.

## EXAMPLES

1) Creating an initial policy:
    $ sudo usbguard generate-policy > rules.conf
    $ vi rules.conf
    (review/modify the rule set)
    $ sudo install -m 0600 -o root -g root \
       rules.conf /etc/usbguard/rules.conf
